# Secured-Pi
Code 401 (Python) - final project

## Description
Python web application for a smart lock powered by Raspberry Pi; features facial recognition for security.
This code is for the main Django server.

## Setup instructions:
First, you need to install OpenCV3 with facial recognition packages.  There
re several ways of doing this, and I recommend researching it if you have not
done this before.
Then:
```
python3 -m venv ENV
source ENV/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
